  "title": "The notion of limit",
  "body": " The notion of limit     Determine the limit of a function at a point using graphical, numerical, and algebraic methods.    Explain how average velocity and instantaneous velocity are connected using the notion of limit.        Algebra: factoring, multiplying out, common denominator, rationalizing    Graphs: holes and jumps      Foundational Exercises  This section is about limits, the behavior of a function's output value as the input value is getting closer and closer (but not equal to) a specified number. A function can be described by a graph, a table of values, or by an algebraic formula, so we work on interpreting limits of functions described in graphical, numerical, and algebraic ways.  It would be helpful to practice how we can interpret information about a function from a graph, or from a piecewise description of a function. Calculating an algebraic limit can also require us to use algebraic simplification techniques such as factoring, combining rational functions using a common denominator, and rationalizing a radical function using the conjugate.  Values of a piecewise function    Given the piecewise function, find the function values.            First find which part of the piecewise function the desired `x`-value is part of, then use that piece to evaluate the function value.                            Values of a piecewise function    Graph the function to find the function values.                                     Output and input values from a graph     (Click on graph to enlarge)  Evaluate , and solve for . If part b has more than one answer, input the larger number in the second field. Otherwise leave the second field blank.  (a)   (b)                            Values from a graph     The graph above shows the cost of mailing a first-class retail flat letter (for example, a letter in a manila envelop), c(x) , as a function of its weight, x , in ounces. Use the graph of the function to find:  a) The cost to mail a 2.7 ounce first-class letter.  Answer:  b) The cost to mail a 1 ounce first-class letter.  Answer:                   Factoring    Factor out the greatest common factor:               Factoring    Rewrite the expression by taking out the greatest common factor and putting it in front.                      Factoring    Factor the given polynomial    If the expression cannot be factored then answer with prime .        The greatest common factor to both terms is , so we can factor the polynomial using the factor by grouping method as follows:   Note that this answer can be checked by using the FOIL ( F irst O utside I nside L ast) technique (exercise).        Factoring    Factor the given polynomial    If the expression cannot be factored then answer with prime .        There is a greatest common factor of . Start by factoring that out.   Then we can factor the remaining expression by grouping.          Factoring    Factor the expression and simplify your answer as much as possible:                       Factoring numerator and denominator    Simplify the rational expression. Answer:    No correct answer specified        Factoring numerator and denominator    Simplify the rational expression. Answer:    No correct answer specified        Adding rational functions    Select all expressions that are equivalent to There may be more than one correct answer.                         Adding rational functions    Perform the indicated operations on the three expressions Express your answer in simplest form .  Answer:  and                   Adding rational functions    Simplify the rational expression in the form . Express the final result in a single fraction using positive exponents only.  Answer:  and                   Adding rational functions    Add or subtract the rational expressions.         The LCD must contain each factor from each denominator, so the LCD = .  We need to rewrite each expression with the LCD:    Notice the subtraction applies to every term in the 2nd fraction:          Radicals and conjugates    Multiply the radical expression and reduce your answer.  Do not use rational exponents. Use \"sqrt(...)\" instead.    Use the distributive property.  Simplify your radicals.  Make sure you're not trying to combine terms that don't have a common radical.  Did you recognize that this is a \"difference of squares\" type problem?        Distribute:   Simplify each product:  First:   Outer:   Inner:   Last:   Bring our simplified terms back together:   Combine like terms:          Rationalizing radicals    Rationalize the denominator.           Type an exact answer using radical notation if necessary.  Help: To enter the square root of a number use sqrt() . For example, to give as an answer, you would type sqrt(7x). If you mistakenly type sqrt 7x instead, Webwork will take this to mean , not . That is, you MUST put parenthesis around everything that you want to take the square root of.                  Rationalizing radicals    Rationalize the denominator.  =    Use sqrt to input a square-root into WeBWorK. For example sqrt(5) represents    Make sure to simplify all square-roots completely.    Make sure your fraction is completely reduced as well.     Remember that your goal is to rationalize the denominator.  You may multiply the numerator and denominator by same expression.  Using binomial conjugates may be useful in this case:   What does this accomplish?  Notice that our result no longer has any radicals...  Make sure your final answer has reduced square-roots and fractions, where possible.        Use the conjugate to rationalize the denominator:    If you didn t catch what happened on that last step, remember:  which simplifies to:  .  Notice that our fraction has a common factor of :  Note that is the common factor - the and the are not cancelling separately!  All our radicals are now simplified, our fraction is reduced, and our denominator contains no radicals.  Answer:         Rationalizing radicals                    Additional Practice Exercises   Limits from a graph    Use the given graph of the function to find the following limits:   1.    2.    3.    4.    5.

Let's review how to write radicals as power functions, as well as powers of in the denominator of a fraction as power functions.  We start with some practice with basic rules of exponents.     Evaluate: for   Note: Your answer should be completely simplified. Unsimplified answers will not be accepted.                Simplify the following expression, and write your answer using only positive exponents.

Using the product rule, we know that . We use slope to compute the derivatives. Since is linear on the interval , we compute the slope of the line to see that on this interval. Similarly, we compute the slope on the interval to see that there. Since has a corner at , we know that does not exist.

  "body": " The chain rule     Recognize the structure of functions composed with other functions and take the derivative of compositions using the Chain Rule.    Use a combination of basic derivative rules (including trigonometric and exponential), product and quotient rules, and chain rule to take the derivative of a complicated function.        Structure of functions: composition, product, quotient    All the derivative rules already covered: power, exponential, trigonometric, product and quotient rules.    What the derivative tells us about a function: the slope of the tangent line, the instantaneous rate of change.     Foundational Exercises  One of the most useful ways of constructing functions from other functions is composition : doing one function and then doing another function to the result. Rather than substituting a number in for the input of a function, we substitute a whole second function in for the input of a function.  We can use our knowledge of how to measure the rates of change of the constituent functions to calculate the rate of change of the more complicated function. We treat the inside or substituted function as if it were a single variable, take the derivative of the outer function with respect to that variable, and multiply by the derivative of the inside function.   The Chain Rule   chain rule If is differentiable at and is differentiable at , then the composite function defined by is differentiable at and .  Another formulation of this rule which says the same thing using different notation is .   Composition from a graph                      Use the graphs of and above to the find the function value.
