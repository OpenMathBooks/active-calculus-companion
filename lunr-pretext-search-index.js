  "title": "The notion of limit",
  "body": " The notion of limit     Determine the limit of a function at a point using graphical, numerical, and algebraic methods.    Explain how average velocity and instantaneous velocity are connected using the notion of limit.        Algebra: factoring, multiplying out, common denominator, rationalizing    Graphs: holes and jumps      Foundations  This section is about limits, the behavior of a function's output value as the input value is getting closer and closer (but not equal to) a specified number. A function can be described by a graph, a table of values, or by an algebraic formula, so we work on interpreting limits of functions described in graphical, numerical, and algebraic ways.  It would be helpful to practice how we can interpret information about a function from a graph, or from a piecewise description of a function. Calculating an algebraic limit can also require us to use algebraic simplification techniques such as factoring, combining rational functions using a common denominator, and rationalizing a radical function using the conjugate.  Values of a piecewise function    Given the piecewise function, find the function values.            First find which part of the piecewise function the desired `x`-value is part of, then use that piece to evaluate the function value.                            Values of a piecewise function    Graph the function to find the function values.                                     Output and input values from a graph     (Click on graph to enlarge)  Evaluate , and solve for . If part b has more than one answer, input the larger number in the second field. Otherwise leave the second field blank.  (a)   (b)                            Values from a graph     The graph above shows the cost of mailing a first-class retail flat letter (for example, a letter in a manila envelop), c(x) , as a function of its weight, x , in ounces. Use the graph of the function to find:  a) The cost to mail a 2.7 ounce first-class letter.  Answer:  b) The cost to mail a 1 ounce first-class letter.  Answer:                   Factoring    Factor out the greatest common factor:               Factoring    Rewrite the expression by taking out the greatest common factor and putting it in front.                      Factoring    Factor the given polynomial    If the expression cannot be factored then answer with prime .        The greatest common factor to both terms is , so we can factor the polynomial using the factor by grouping method as follows:   Note that this answer can be checked by using the FOIL ( F irst O utside I nside L ast) technique (exercise).        Factoring    Factor the given polynomial    If the expression cannot be factored then answer with prime .        There is a greatest common factor of . Start by factoring that out.   Then we can factor the remaining expression by grouping.          Factoring    Factor the expression and simplify your answer as much as possible:                       Factoring numerator and denominator    Simplify the rational expression. Answer:    No correct answer specified        Factoring numerator and denominator    Simplify the rational expression. Answer:    No correct answer specified        Adding rational functions    Select all expressions that are equivalent to There may be more than one correct answer.                         Adding rational functions    Perform the indicated operations on the three expressions Express your answer in simplest form .  Answer:  and                   Adding rational functions    Simplify the rational expression in the form . Express the final result in a single fraction using positive exponents only.  Answer:  and                   Adding rational functions    Add or subtract the rational expressions.         The LCD must contain each factor from each denominator, so the LCD = .  We need to rewrite each expression with the LCD:    Notice the subtraction applies to every term in the 2nd fraction:          Radicals and conjugates    Multiply the radical expression and reduce your answer.  Do not use rational exponents. Use \"sqrt(...)\" instead.    Use the distributive property.  Simplify your radicals.  Make sure you're not trying to combine terms that don't have a common radical.  Did you recognize that this is a \"difference of squares\" type problem?        Distribute:   Simplify each product:  First:   Outer:   Inner:   Last:   Bring our simplified terms back together:   Combine like terms:          Rationalizing radicals    Rationalize the denominator.           Type an exact answer using radical notation if necessary.  Help: To enter the square root of a number use sqrt() . For example, to give as an answer, you would type sqrt(7x). If you mistakenly type sqrt 7x instead, Webwork will take this to mean , not . That is, you MUST put parenthesis around everything that you want to take the square root of.                  Rationalizing radicals    Rationalize the denominator.  =    Use sqrt to input a square-root into WeBWorK. For example sqrt(5) represents    Make sure to simplify all square-roots completely.    Make sure your fraction is completely reduced as well.     Remember that your goal is to rationalize the denominator.  You may multiply the numerator and denominator by same expression.  Using binomial conjugates may be useful in this case:   What does this accomplish?  Notice that our result no longer has any radicals...  Make sure your final answer has reduced square-roots and fractions, where possible.        Use the conjugate to rationalize the denominator:    If you didn t catch what happened on that last step, remember:  which simplifies to:  .  Notice that our fraction has a common factor of :  Note that is the common factor - the and the are not cancelling separately!  All our radicals are now simplified, our fraction is reduced, and our denominator contains no radicals.

  "body": " The chain rule     Recognize the structure of functions composed with other functions and take the derivative of compositions using the Chain Rule.    Use a combination of basic derivative rules (including trigonometric and exponential), product and quotient rules, and chain rule to take the derivative of a complicated function.        Structure of functions: composition, product, quotient    All the derivative rules already covered: power, exponential, trigonometric, product and quotient rules.    What the derivative tells us about a function: the slope of the tangent line, the instantaneous rate of change.     Foundations  One of the most useful ways of constructing functions from other functions is composition : doing one function and then doing another function to the result. Rather than substituting a number in for the input of a function, we substitute a whole second function in for the input of a function.  We can use our knowledge of how to measure the rates of change of the constituent functions to calculate the rate of change of the more complicated function. We treat the inside or substituted function as if it were a single variable, take the derivative of the outer function with respect to that variable, and multiply by the derivative of the inside function.   The Chain Rule   chain rule If is differentiable at and is differentiable at , then the composite function defined by is differentiable at and .  Another formulation of this rule which says the same thing using different notation is .   Composition from a graph                      Use the graphs of and above to the find the function value.

To find where the tangent line is horizontal, set the numerator equal to and solve for either or in terms of the other variable, then substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve to solve the equation of one variable. To find where the tangent line is vertical, we do the same thing but with setting the denominator of equal to 0.

Solving an equation with multiple variables  In implicit differentiation problems, you will often end up with an equation involving , , and , and you will need to solve the equation for what equals.  It would be good to have some practice solving equations for a variable, including factoring out by the variable.    Previous derivative rules and notation  Implicitly defined functions often involve sums, products, quotients, and compositions. This means that you need to recognize the structure of the different terms in the function and apply the appropriate derivative rules correctly.

Differentiating the equation with respect to and treating the width as constant, we have           A spherical balloon is to be deflated so that its radius decreases at a constant rate of cm\/min. At what rate must air be removed when the radius is cm?  Answer:                 Suppose a police officer is 1\/2 mile south of an intersection, driving north towards the intersection at 45 mph. At the same time, another car is 1\/2 mile east of the intersection, driving east (away from the intersection) at an unknown speed. The officer's radar gun indicates 25 mph when pointed at the other car (that is, the straight-line distance between the officer and the other car is increasing at a rate of 25 mph). What is the speed of the other car?  Speed = mph.  Now suppose that the officer's radar gun indicates -25 mph instead (that is, the straight-line distance is decreasing at a rate of 25 mph). What is the speed of the other car this time?  Speed = mph.             Solution: The two cars and the intersection form a right triangle. Let distance from the officer's car to the intersection (along the north-south street), and distance from the intersection to the other car (along the west-east street). Let straight-line distance from the officer's car to the other car. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, . Take time-derivatives of both sides of this equation. Then plug in the known information and solve. We have , which is negative because the distance from the officer to the intersection is decreasing. We also have . We can find the distance between the cars at this specific moment: . For the second part, .           A 17 foot ladder is leaning against a wall.  If the top slips down the wall at a rate of 2 ft\/s, how fast will the foot be moving away from the wall when the top is 16 feet above the ground?  The foot will be moving at ft\/s.                A aircraft is climbing at a 30 degree angle to the horizontal. How fast is the aircraft gaining altitude if its speed is mi\/h?  Answer:                A potter forms a piece of clay into a right circular cylinder. As she rolls it, the height of the cylinder increases and the radius decreases. Assume that no clay is lost in the process. Suppose the height of the cylinder is increasing by centimeters per second. What is the rate at which the radius is changing when the radius is centimeters and the height is centimeters?  (Include with your answer.)                A boat is pulled into a dock by means of a rope attached to a pulley on the dock. The rope is attached to the front of the boat, which is 6 feet below the level of the pulley.  If the rope is pulled through the pulley at a rate of 10 ft\/min, at what rate will the boat be approaching the dock when 100 ft of rope is out?  The boat will be approaching the dock at ft\/min.  Hint : Sketch a diagram of this situation.                 A rope, attached to a weight, goes up through a pulley at the ceiling and back down to a worker. The worker holds the rope at the same height as the connection point between the rope and weight. The distance from the connection point to the ceiling is 30 ft. Suppose the worker stands directly next to the weight (i.e., a total rope length of 60 ft) and begins to walk away at a constant rate of 4 ft\/s. How fast is the weight rising when the worker has walked:    10 feet? Answer      30 feet? Answer                 Solution: The worker, weight and pulley form a right triangle with height 30, base length , and hypotenuse . The speed at which the weight rises is the same as the speed the rope is being pulled. This means the rate we are looking for is .

Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of 30 . It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone whose base diameter and height are always the same.  How fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is 10 ft high?  The height is increasing at ft\/min.                A street light is at the top of a 26 ft pole. A 6 ft tall girl walks along a straight path away from the pole with a speed of 8 ft\/sec.  At what rate is the tip of her shadow moving away from the light (ie. away from the top of the pole) when the girl is 47 ft away from the pole?  Answer:  How fast is her shadow lengthening?  Answer:                     Suppose that two boats leave a dock at different times. One heads due north, the other due east. Find the rate at which the distance between the boats is changing when the first boat is 44 miles from the dock traveling at a speed of 48 miles per hour and the second boat is 77 miles from the dock traveling at a speed of 32 miles per hour.  Answer:                A water trough is long and a cross-section has the shape of an isosceles trapezoid that is wide at the bottom, wide at the top, and has height . If the trough is being filled with water at a rate of , how fast is the water level rising when the water is deep?

The angle of elevation of the camera has to change at the correct rate in order to keep the rocket in sight.

Setting this equal to zero and solving for gives . Evaluating yields the critical value -6. Evaluating and , we find that each is equal to 10. The extreme values must occur at critical points or at the endpoints of the interval.

Consider a window the shape of which is a rectangle of height surmounted by a triangle having a height that is 1.2 times the width of the rectangle (as shown in the figure below).   If the cross-sectional area is , determine the dimensions of the window which minimize the perimeter.                 , and the area of the triangle is . Thus the cross-sectional area, is The perimeter of the window is , where is the length of the angled top edges of the triangle. We can find by looking at half of the triangle and using the Pythagorean theorem: . Thus From we get . Thus, We now have the perimeter in terms of and the constant . Differentiating, we obtain To find the critical points we set and solve for , finding . Substituting this back into our expression for , we have Since as and as , this critical point must be a global minimum. We can also see this because it is the only critical point and the second derivative, , indicating that is concave up.          A wire 8 meters long is cut into two pieces. One piece is bent into a square for a frame for a stained glass ornament, while the other piece is bent into a circle for a TV antenna. To reduce storage space, where should the wire be cut to minimize the total area of both figures? Give the length of wire used for each:  For the square:  For the circle:  (for both, include )  Where should the wire be cut to maximize the total area? Again, give the length of wire used for each:  For the square:  For the circle:  (for both, include )                       the total area enclosed by the two figures . Our first task is therefore to find an equation for this area, which will be the sum of the areas of the two figures. Suppose we cut meters of wire to make the circular antenna. Then there are meters left for the square. To find the area of the circle we need its radius. The circumference of a circle of radius is , so the radius of the circle is given by , and so . The area of the circular antenna is therefore . Then the perimeter of a square with side length is , so the side length is . Then the area of a square is , so the area of the square is . The total area is therefore The domain for is . The maximum and minimum of will occur at critical or end points. Critical points are where , or, where Collecting all terms in we have so, after simplifying, To determine if this is a local maximum or minimum, we use the second derivative test. so the function is concave up everywhere and this is a local, and because there is only one critical point, global, minimum. Thus to minimize area we use meters of wire for the circle and meters for the square. To maximize the area, we must use the endpoints. The areas at the endpoints are the larger of which is , so the maximum area occurs when all of the wire is used for the circle and none for the square.          Some airlines have restrictions on the size of items of luggage that passengers are allowed to take with them. Suppose that one has a rule that the sum of the length, width and height of any piece of luggage must be less than or equal to 234 cm. A passenger wants to take a box of the maximum allowable volume. If the length and width are to be equal, what should the dimensions be?  length = width =  height =  In this case, what is the volume?  volume =  (for each, include )  If the length is be twice the width, what should the dimensions be?  length =  width =  height =  In this case, what is the volume?  volume =  (for each, include )                                      , and , respectively. Then the volume of the box is . The sum , and, for the first part, we know that . Thus , so , and the volume equation becomes . The domain for is . Critical points are where , so or .

What should be the dimensions of the poster so that the printed area be as large as possible?  To solve this problem let denote the width of the poster in inches and let denote the length in inches. We need to maximize the following function of and :  We can reexpress this as the following function of alone:    We find that has a critical number at  To verify that has a maximum at this critical number we compute the second derivative and find that its value at the critical number is , a negative number.  Thus the optimal dimensions of the poster are inches in width and inches in height giving us a maximumal printed area of square inches.                                              A certain magical substance that is used to make solid magical spheres costs per cubic foot.

Note 1: the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere of radius are and respectively.  Note 2: on a real exam you would be expected to justify that the answer above is actually a maximum, rather than, say a minimum.                If 1100 square centimeters of material is available to make a box with a square base and an open top, find the largest possible volume of the box.  Volume = (include )        be the length of the sides of the square base. Then, if is the height of the box, the volume is given by . We need to find an expression for the height in terms of . This is where we use our information about the amount of material used in constructing the box. If the base of the box has sides of length , then square centimeters of material are used to make the base. Therefore, we have only square centimeters of material left to make the sides, of which there are four. Each of the sides uses square centimeters of material. Therefore, we get the formula: Plugging this into our formula for volume, we can now write out as: Now, we take the derivative of this expression, using the rules for taking derivatives of polynomials, to get . Setting this equal to 0 will give us the critical points. When solving, remember that this is a real world situation, so we can not have a negative value for (which is a length). Now, plugging this width into our formula for volume, , we get the maximal volume of .          A rectangular storage container with an open top is to have a volume of 16 cubic meters. The length of its base is twice the width. Material for the base costs 15 dollars per square meter. Material for the sides costs 5 dollars per square meter. Find the cost of materials for the cheapest such container.  Total cost = (Round to the nearest penny and include monetary units. For example, if your answer is 1.095, enter $1.10 including the dollar sign and second decimal place.)        SOLUTION  Let and denote the width of the base and the height of the container, respectively.  Since the length of the base is twice the width, the volume of the container is so The sides have total area , while the base has area , so the cost is Substuting the expression for gives   is the critical number. There is an absolute minimum at this critical number since for and for .  The total minimum cost is           A steel pipe is being carried down a hallway 9 ft wide.

Therefore, we have only square centimeters of material left to make the sides, of which there are four. Each of the sides uses square centimeters of material. Therefore, we get the formula: Plugging this into our formula for volume, we can now write out as: Now, we take the derivative of this expression, using the rules for taking derivatives of polynomials, to get . Setting this equal to 0 will give us the critical points. When solving, remember that this is a real world situation, so we can not have a negative value for (which is a length). Now, plugging this width into our formula for volume, , we get the maximal volume of .      "

Total cost = (Round to the nearest penny and include monetary units. For example, if your answer is 1.095, enter $1.10 including the dollar sign and second decimal place.)        SOLUTION  Let and denote the width of the base and the height of the container, respectively.  Since the length of the base is twice the width, the volume of the container is so The sides have total area , while the base has area , so the cost is Substuting the expression for gives   is the critical number. There is an absolute minimum at this critical number since for and for .  The total minimum cost is       "
