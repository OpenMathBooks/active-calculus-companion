        <p>
          You may remember learning that a function has to pass the Vertical Line Test which is a visual way
          of seeing if each input resulted in exactly 1 output, not 2 or 3 or more outputs for the same input.  We now would call that an <em>explicit</em> 
          function of <m>x</m>; an <em>implicit function</em> does not need to pass the Vertical Line Test.  It would
          be more accurate to say that <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>, but it is not necessarily a function of <m>x</m>.

        <p>
          In implicit differentiation problems, the formula for
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is usually a fraction. To find where the tangent line is horizontal, set the
          numerator equal to <m>0</m> and solve for either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> in terms of the other variable, then
          substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve to solve the equation of one variable.
          To find where the tangent line is vertical, we do the same thing but with setting the denominator 
          of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> equal to 0.

      <title>Solving an equation with multiple variables</title>
      <p>
        In implicit differentiation problems, you will often end up with an equation involving <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, 
        and <m>\frac{dy}{x}</m>, and you will need to solve the equation for what <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> equals. 
      </p>

        It would be good to have some practice solving equations for a variable, including factoring out by the variable.

      <p>
        Implicitly defined functions often involve sums, products, quotients, and compositions.  This means that 
        you need to recognize the structure of the different terms in the function and apply the appropriate
        derivative rules correctly.

      <title>Different notations for the derivative</title>
      <p>
        The difference between
        <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> can be confusing.  <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m> is a verb and means <q>take the derivative of what comes next</q>; 
        <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is a noun and means <q>the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</q>  Both <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> and <m>y'</m> are equivalent notations,
        but we prefer to use the different forms at different times for reasons that are hard to understand now.

          <p>
            In the problems below, treat <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, which means that you need
            to use chain rule to take the derivative with respect to <m>x</m> of expressions involving <m>y</m>.
