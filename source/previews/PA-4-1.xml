    Suppose that a person is taking a walk along a long straight path and walks at a constant rate of 3 miles per hour.

          On the left-hand axes provided in the following figure,
          sketch a labeled graph of the velocity function <m>v(t) = 3</m>.
          Note that while the scale on the two sets of axes is the same,
          the units on the right-hand axes differ from those on the left.
          The right-hand axes will be used in question (d).
