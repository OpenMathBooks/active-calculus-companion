          Recall that one model for population growth states that a population grows at a rate proportional to its size.  In symbols: <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</m>.

            We begin with the differential equation

          Let's now consider a modified differential equation given by
          <me>
            \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac 12 P(3-P)
          </me>.
          As before,
          sketch a slope field as well as a few typical solutions on the following axes provided.
