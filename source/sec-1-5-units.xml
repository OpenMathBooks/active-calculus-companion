          In contexts other than the position of a moving object, what does the derivative of a function measure?

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          What are the units on the derivative function <m>f'</m>, and how are they related to the units of the original function <m>f</m>?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          What is a central difference, and how can one be used to estimate the value of the derivative at a point from given function data?

          Given the value of the derivative of a function at a point, what can we infer about how the value of the function changes nearby?

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <ul>

          <p>
            The derivative of a given function <m>y=f(x)</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of the output variable with respect to the input variable.  It also predicts about how much change we can expect when the input variable changes a small amount.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The units on the derivative function
            <m>y = f'(x)</m> are units of <m>f</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.
            Again,
            this measures how fast the output of the function <m>f</m> changes when the input variable changes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The central difference approximation to the value of the first derivative is given by
            <me>
              f'(a) \approx \frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h}
            </me>.
            This quantity measures the slope of the secant line to <m>y = f(x)</m> through the points
            <m>(a-h, f(a-h))</m> and <m>(a+h, f(a+h))</m>.
            The central difference generates a good approximation of the derivative's value at <m>x = a</m>.
