  <statement>
    <p>
        A swimmer is doing laps back and forth in a 50-meter long pool; she is maintaining a constant speed of 0.8 meters per second. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
              Explain why it takes her 62.5 seconds to swim one length of the pool. How long does it take her to swim one full lap (back and forth)?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sketch a graph of her velocity function <m>v(t)</m> over, say, four laps; notice that her velocity switches from positive to negative when she touches the far wall and turns to swim back.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use your graph to explain why <m>\displaystyle\int_{t=0}^{125} v(t)\ dt = 0.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the meaning of the value of the definite integral in part (c)?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In 125 seconds at a constant speed of 0.8 meters per second, the swimmer covered a total distance of 100 meters. Why then did you get something very different in part (c)?
          </p>
