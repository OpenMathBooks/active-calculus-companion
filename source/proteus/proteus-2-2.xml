<title>PROTEUS exercises</title>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-2-2">Preview Activity</xref>, we reasoned graphically to sketch the derivative of <m>g(x) = 2^x</m>.  The following questions remind us of some key ideas related to sketching the graph of the derivative, given a graph of the original function.

<exercise component="proteus" label="proteus-2-2-quad"  xml:id="proteus-2-2-quad">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>q(x) = 2 - (x-1)^2</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this quadratic function.  From the graph, at what value(s) of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x) = 0</m>? (Remember: <m>q'(x) = 0</m> wherever the tangent line to <m>q(x)</m> is horizontal.)  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x)</m> positive?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x)</m> negative?

<exercise component="proteus" label="proteus-2-2-sin"  xml:id="proteus-2-2-sin">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this trigonometric function.  State 3 values of <m>x</m> for which <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.  What is one interval of values of <m>x</m> on which <m>f'(x)</m> is positive?  What is one interval of values of <m>x</m> on which <m>f'(x)</m> is negative?

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>g(x) = \cos(x)</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this trigonometric function.  State 3 values of <m>x</m> for which <m>g'(x) = 0</m>.  What is one interval of values of <m>x</m> on which <m>g'(x)</m> is positive? What is one interval of values of <m>x</m> on which <m>g'(x)</m> is negative?
