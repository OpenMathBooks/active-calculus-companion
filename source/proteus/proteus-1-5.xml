  <statement>
    <p>
      The time (<m>T</m>, measured in hours) it takes to drive 50 miles along State Highway 46 depends on the constant speed at which you are driving (<m>s</m>, measured in mph). Since 
      <me>
        \text{distance traveled} = \text{speed}\cdot \text{travel time},
      </me> 
      <m>T(s) = 50/s.</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Draw a graph of this function and explain why the shape of this graph makes sense.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the value of <m>T(60)</m>? Give units on your answer. What does this value mean in context?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find the average rate of change of <m>T</m> on the interval <m>[60, 65]</m>, <m>AV_{[60, 65]}</m>. Give units on your answer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is the sign of <m>AV_{[60, 65]}</m> positive or negative? Why does this sign make sense in light of the graph of <m>T(s)</m>? Explain your thinking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write a sentence in everyday language explaining the meaning of the value <m>AV_{[60, 65]}</m> in context. Include units in your sentence.

  <statement>
    <p>
      Wind turbines are used to generate electricity. The power, <m>P</m>, measured in watts, depends on the windspeed, <m>s</m>, measured in mph. For a particular wind turbine,
      <me>
        P(s) = 2.4 s^3.
      </me>
      Find the average rate of change of <m>P</m> on the interval <m>[20, 22]</m>, <m>AV_{[20, 22]}</m>, and write a sentence that explains the meaning of the value <m>AV_{[20, 22]}</m> to someone not taking calculus. Include units in your sentence.
