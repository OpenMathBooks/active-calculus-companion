    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A function <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x \to a</m> if and only if <m>f</m> has a left-hand limit at <m>x = a</m>,
            <m>f</m> has a right-hand limit at <m>x = a</m>,
            and the left- and right-hand limits are equal.
            Visually,
            this means that there can be a hole in the graph at <m>x = a</m>,
            but the function must approach the same single value from either side of <m>x = a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            A function <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x = a</m> whenever <m>f(a)</m> is defined,
            <m>f</m> has a limit as <m>x \to a</m>,
            and the value of the limit and the value of the function agree.
            This guarantees that there is not a hole or jump in the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>x = a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            A function <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x = a</m> whenever <m>f'(a)</m> exists,
            which means that <m>f</m> has a tangent line at
            <m>(a,f(a))</m> and thus <m>f</m> is locally linear at <m>x = a</m>.
            Informally,
            this means that the function looks like a line when viewed up close at
            <m>(a,f(a))</m> and that there is not a corner point or cusp at <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Of the three conditions discussed in this section
            (having a limit at <m>x = a</m>,
            being continuous at <m>x = a</m>,
            and being differentiable at <m>x = a</m>),
            the strongest condition is being differentiable,
            and the next strongest is being continuous.
            In particular, if <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x = a</m>,
            then <m>f</m> is also continuous at <m>x = a</m>,
            and if <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x = a</m>,
            then <m>f</m> has a limit at <m>x = a</m>.
