            The limit definition of the derivative,
            <m>f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>,
            produces a value for each <m>x</m> at which the derivative is defined,
            and this leads to a new function <m>y = f'(x)</m>.
            It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function (<m>f</m>) and produces a new,
            related function
            (<m>f'</m>).

        <li>
          <p>
            There is essentially no difference between writing <m>f'(a)</m>
            (as we did regularly in <xref ref="sec-1-3-derivative-pt">Section</xref>)
            and writing <m>f'(x)</m>.
            In either case,
            the variable is just a placeholder that is used to define the rule for the derivative function.

        <li>
          <p>
            Given the graph of a function <m>y = f(x)</m>,
            we can sketch an approximate graph of its derivative
            <m>y = f'(x)</m> by observing that <em>heights</em>
            on the derivative's graph correspond to <em>slopes</em>
            on the original function's graph.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            In <xref ref="act-1-4-1">Activity</xref>,
            we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs,
            such as the shifted absolute value function.
            At such points, the derivative fails to exist,
            and we say that <m>f</m> is not differentiable there.
            For now,
            it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.
