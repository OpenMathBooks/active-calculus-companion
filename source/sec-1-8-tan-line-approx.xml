          How does knowing the second derivative's value at this point provide us additional knowledge of the original function's behavior?

            The tangent line to a differentiable function <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point
            <m>(a,f(a))</m> is given in point-slope form by the equation
            <me>
              y - f(a) = f'(a)(x-a)
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The principle of local linearity tells us that if we zoom in on a point where a function <m>y = f(x)</m> is differentiable,
            the function will be indistinguishable from its tangent line.
            That is,
            a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close.
            We rename the tangent line to be the function
            <m>y = L(x)</m>, where <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m>.
            Thus,
            <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>x = a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If we know the tangent line approximation
            <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m> to a function <m>y=f(x)</m>,
            then because <m>L(a) = f(a)</m> and <m>L'(a) = f'(a)</m>,
            we also know the values of both the function
            and its derivative at the point where <m>x = a</m>.
            In other words,
            the linear approximation tells us the height and slope of the original function.
            If, in addition, we know the value of <m>f''(a)</m>,
            we then know whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of
            <m>y = f(x)</m>, depending on the concavity of <m>f</m>.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      To be able to find the equation of a tangent line, you must know how to find the equation of a line given a point and a slope.  Here are some practice exercises for this foundational skill.
