              From the given graph of <m>f'</m>,
              the first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m> shows that <m>f</m> has critical numbers at
              <m>x = -1, 1</m> and that <m>f'</m> is positive for
              <m>-1 \lt x \lt 1</m> and for <m>x \gt 1</m>,
              while being negative for all <m>x \lt -1</m>.
              Hence <m>f</m> is increasing for
              <m>-1 \lt x \lt 1</m> and for <m>x \gt 1</m>,
              and decreasing for <m>x \lt -1</m>.
              It follows by the first derivative test that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m> because <m>f</m> changes from decreasing to increasing there.

              Based on where <m>f'(x)</m> has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative,
              we can sketch an approximate graph of
              <m>y = f''(x)</m> in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function.
              From the given graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
              we can see that <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,
              <m>f''(x)</m> is negative because <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing,
              while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else since <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing everywhere else.
              A possible graph of <m>y = f''(x)</m> is shown at right in the following figure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              From our sketch of the second derivative in (b),
              we can develop a second derivative sign chart for <m>f</m>.
              In particular, we saw that
              <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,
              <m>f''(x)</m> is negative, while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else.
              This shows that <m>f</m> is concave down for
              <m>-0.35 \lt x \lt 1</m> while being concave up everywhere else.
              We thus see that <m>f</m> has points of inflection at both <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now that we know where <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing as well as where <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down,
              along with the fact that <m>f(0) = -0.5</m>,
              we can sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.
              Note that we also know <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = 1</m> while being increasing on either side of <m>x = 1</m>,
              and earlier we established that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m>.
              After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through <m>(0,-0.5)</m>,
              we arrive at the graph shown at left below.

              The slopes of the tangent lines to <m>h</m> will all be near <m>3</m>,
              but less than <m>3</m>, as <m>x</m> gets large.
              So the graph of <m>h</m> will look very much like a line with slope <m>3</m> for large values of <m>x</m>.

              We note that <m>h'</m> is increasing everywhere,
              <m>h</m> is concave up everywhere.
              Since the graph of <m>h'</m> levels off for large values of <m>|x|</m>,
              the concavity of <m>h</m> is small when <m>|x|</m> is large.
              Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to <m>h'</m> occurs when <m>x=0</m>,
              so <m>h</m> has its largest second dervitive when <m>x=0</m>.
              So <m>h</m> is almost linear as <m>x</m> decreases without bound,
              <m>h</m> has more bend as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>,
              has its greatest bend at <m>x=0</m>,
              then the second derivative of <m>h</m> as <m>x</m> increases,
              ultimately having <m>h</m> become almost linear as <m>x</m> increases without bound.

                Since <m>g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}</m>,
                we see that <m>g'(x) = 0</m> implies that <m>x = -4</m> or <m>x = 1</m>.
                While <m>x = 2</m> makes <m>g'</m> undefined,
                we are told that <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m>,
                so <m>x = 2</m> is not in the domain of <m>g</m>,
                and hence is technically not a critical number of <m>g</m>.
                Nonetheless,
                we place <m>x = 2</m> on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which <m>g'</m> may change sign.

                The first derivative sign chart shows that <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \lt -4</m>,
                <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>-4 \lt x \lt 1</m>,
                <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>1 \lt x \lt 2</m>,
                and <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \gt 2</m>.
                By the first derivative test,
                <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m> and neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>.
                As these are the only two critical numbers,
                these are the only two locations for possible extremes.
                (Note:
                although <m>g</m> changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x = 2</m>,
                this is due to a vertical asymptote,
                and <m>g</m> does not have a minimum there.)

                Because <m>g</m> is decreasing as <m>x \to 2^-</m>
                (where <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote),
                <m>g</m> does not have a global minimum.
                For <m>x \gt 2</m>, <m>g</m> is always increasing,
                which suggests that <m>g</m> does not have a global maximum
                (though we do not know for sure that <m>g</m> increases without bound).

                Since <m>g'(x) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
                this tells us that <m>g</m> increases without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.

                a horizontal tangent line with neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>,

              Note that <m>p''(x)=0</m> at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
              The second derivative sign chart for <m>p</m> shows that <m>p''(x)</m> is negative for
              <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m> and positive for all other values of <m>x</m>.
              Since <m>p''</m> changes sign at <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 2</m>,
              <m>p</m> has points of inflection at <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 2</m>.
              In particular, <m>p</m> is concave down for
              <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m> and concave up for all other values of <m>x</m>.

              If we compute <m>p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right)</m>,
              we find that <m>p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right) \approx -1.205</m>,
              which means that <m>p</m> is concave down at <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m>.
              Since <m>p</m> has a horizontal tangent line at this point,
              it follows that <m>p</m> has a local maximum at

              Since <m>p(2) = \frac{12}{e^2}</m> and <m>p'(2) = -\frac{5}{e^2}</m>,
              the equation of the tangent line to <m>p</m> at <m>x = 2</m> is given by <m>y = -\frac{5}{e^2}(x-2) + \frac{12}{e^2}</m>.
              To determine whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of <m>y=p(x)</m> at <m>x = 2</m>,
              we consider the concavity of <m>p</m>.
              Recall we know that <m>p''(2) = 0</m> and that <m>p</m> is concave down to the left of <m>x = 2</m> and concave up to the right.
              Thus, the tangent line lies neither solely below nor solely above the graph of <m>y = p(x)</m> at <m>x = 2</m>;
              it lies below <m>y = p(x)</m> to the right of <m>x = 2</m> and above
              <m>y = p(x)</m> to the left of <m>x = 2</m>.
