          <p>
            Given a differentiable function <m>y = f(x)</m>,
            we can express the derivative of <m>f</m> in several different notations:
            <m>f'(x)</m>, <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m>,
            <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, and <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The limit definition of the derivative leads to patterns among certain families of functions that enable us to compute derivative formulas without resorting directly to the limit definition.
            For example,
            if <m>f</m> is a power function of the form <m>f(x) = x^n</m>,
            then <m>f'(x) = nx^{n-1}</m> for any real number <m>n</m> other than 0.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We have stated a rule for derivatives of exponential functions in the same spirit as the rule for power functions:
            for any positive real number <m>a</m>,
            if <m>f(x) = a^x</m>, then <m>f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If we are given a constant multiple of a function whose derivative we know,
            or a sum of functions whose derivatives we know,
            the Constant Multiple and Sum Rules make it straightforward to compute the derivative of the overall function.
            More formally,
            if <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are differentiable with derivatives <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>g'(x)</m> and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, then
            <me>
              \frac{d}{dx} \left[af(x) + bg(x)\right] = af'(x) + bg'(x)
            </me>.

      Sometimes before computing a derivative, it is helpful to rewrite the function in a more standard form.  Let's review how to write radicals as power functions, as well as powers of <m>x</m> in the denominator of a fraction as power functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      We start with some practice with basic rules of exponents.
